# Coffee2Water-Ratio-Calculator
This was done mostly for my benefit, but everyone is welcome to use and modify it. 
It takes a water measurement, the desired coffee/water ratio, and gives you back the amount of ground coffee you need. 
If you need it there's a couple of empirical to metric conversion on the "Conversion" page.
On the "Conversion" page, you have to clear out text fields before attempting to do another conversion.
Otherwise, it will keep converting whatever is in the field currently.

It occured to me that I should include the source code. So, I did.
