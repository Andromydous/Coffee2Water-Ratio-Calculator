# Coffee2Water-Ratio-Calculator
This was done mostly for my benefit, but everyone is welcome to use and modify it. It takes a water measurement, the desired coffee/water ratio, and gives you back the amount of ground coffee you need. If you need it there's a couple of empirical to metric conversion on the "Conversion" page.
